4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy
   - Build uses: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build`

## Verification

After deployment:
1. Check build logs for any errors
2. Verify the application starts successfully
3. Test authentication flow
4. Verify database connections

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify database is accessible from Railway
3. Check build logs for specific errors
4. Ensure Redis instance is available
