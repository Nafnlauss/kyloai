# RBAC + User Deletion + Menu Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. **User Deletion Endpoint** (`DELETE /api/admin/users/:id`)
- Updated `/src/app/api/admin/users/[userId]/route.ts`
- Added transactional deletion of:
  - `apiLog` records
  - `payment` records
  - All other related data (videos, transactions, sessions, etc.)
- Returns 204 No Content on success
- Includes Supabase Auth deletion
- Only ADMIN role can delete users

### 2. **RBAC Middleware Implementation**
- Updated `/src/lib/auth/admin-guard.ts`
- Added `adminGuardAPI()` function for API route protection
- Added `withAdminAPI()` wrapper function
- Supports both ADMIN and MODERATOR roles
- Maintains demo mode compatibility

### 3. **Menu Updates**
- Updated `/src/components/admin/admin-header.tsx`
- Removed "Settings" and "Profile" menu items
- Kept only "Logout" in the user dropdown menu
- Removed unused imports

### 4. **Delete Confirmation Dialog**
- Already implemented in `/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`
- Shows AlertDialog before deletion
- Updated to handle 204 response correctly
- Shows success toast: "User removed successfully"

### 5. **Client-Side Protection HOC**
- Created `/src/components/auth/with-admin-auth.tsx`
- Protects pages from unauthorized access
- Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
- Redirects to `/dashboard` with toast if not admin/moderator

### 6. **API Routes Protection Applied**
- `/api/admin/users` - ADMIN and MODERATOR access
- `/api/admin/transactions` - ADMIN and MODERATOR access
- `/api/admin/users/[userId]/role` - ADMIN only
- `/api/admin/users/[userId]` (DELETE) - ADMIN only

## üîí Security Features

1. **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
   - ADMIN: Full access to all features
   - MODERATOR: Read access, cannot delete or change roles
   - USER: No access to admin panel

2. **Protection mechanisms**
   - Cannot delete own account
   - Cannot change own role
   - Cannot delete other admins
   - All actions logged in audit trail

3. **Error handling**
   - 401 Unauthorized - No authentication
   - 403 Forbidden - Insufficient permissions
   - 400 Bad Request - Invalid operations
   - 204 No Content - Successful deletion

## üìù Usage Notes

- Set `ADMIN_DEMO_MODE=true` in `.env.local` for demo mode (bypasses auth)
- All admin routes now require ADMIN or MODERATOR role
- User deletion is permanent and cascades through all related data
- Moderators can view but not modify critical data

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] User with role=USER cannot access /admin
- [ ] User with role=MODERATOR can access /admin but cannot delete users
- [ ] User with role=ADMIN can delete users (except themselves)
- [ ] Deleted user data is removed from both database and Supabase Auth
- [ ] Menu shows only Logout option
- [ ] API routes return proper error codes for unauthorized access

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- Update environment variables if needed
- Test RBAC thoroughly before production deployment
- Monitor audit logs for unauthorized access attempts
