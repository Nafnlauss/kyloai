# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: Cached Dockerfile

Railway is using a cached version of the Dockerfile with the old `openssl1.1-compat` package that doesn't exist.

## Solutions:

### 1. Clear Railway Cache (Recommended)
In your Railway project:
1. Go to Settings → General
2. Find "Clear Build Cache" button
3. Click to clear the cache
4. Redeploy

### 2. Force New Build
- Push the new commit we just made
- The changed comments should force Railway to use the new Dockerfile

### 3. Manual Deploy Command
If the above doesn't work, in Railway:
1. Go to Settings → Deploy
2. Override the build command with:
   ```
   docker build --no-cache -t app .
   ```

### 4. Alternative: Use Different Base Image
If Alpine continues to cause issues, we can switch to a Debian-based image:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-slim
# No need to install OpenSSL - already included
```

## What We Fixed:
- ❌ OLD: `RUN apk add --no-cache openssl1.1-compat` (package doesn't exist)
- ✅ NEW: `RUN apk add --no-cache openssl openssl-dev libc6-compat` (correct packages)

## Next Steps:
1. Push the changes: `git push origin main`
2. Clear Railway build cache if needed
3. Monitor the new build

The error should be resolved once Railway uses the updated Dockerfile.
